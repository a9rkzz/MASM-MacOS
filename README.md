# MASM for MacOS
## What is this?
This project is a fancy makefile, and a rewrite of Richard Demter's IO File to work on MacOS

## How do I use it?
1. Install XCode -- From the App Store
2. Clone this project -- `git clone https://github.com/a9rkzz/MASM-Unix.git`
4. Write your code
5. Test your code -- `make`
6. Look at all the hard drive space saved by not setting up Visual Studio *or* WINE, and celebrate
